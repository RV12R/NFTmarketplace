# NFT Marketplace

We've all heard of OpenSea, and maybe even of other marketplaces such as LooksRare. These platforms allow users to buy and sell all sorts of NFTs on their platforms, bringing a decentralized market to these digital mediums.<br>

This is a simple NFT marketplace completely from scratch on Celo!

We will use a bunch of developer tools to make this possible, and this is going to be an amazing level!

- Hardhat
- NextJS (React)
- Celo
- The Graph
- Rainbowkit
- Wagmi
- Ethers.js
- Metamask / Alfajores Wallet
